  "description": "HL7-defined code system of concepts identifying the repeat status for the analyte/result (e.g. original, rerun, repeat, reflex).  The following are assumptions regarding the table values:\r\nRepeated without dilution — performed usually to confirm correctness of results (e.g., in case of results flagged as \"Panic\" or mechanical failures).\r\nRepeated with dilution — performed usually in the case the original result exceeded the measurement range (technical limits).\r\nReflex test — this test is performed as the consequence of rules triggered based on other test result(s).  Used in HL7 Version 2.x messaging in the Test Code Detail (TCD) segment.",
