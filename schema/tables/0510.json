  "description": "HL7-defined code system of concepts used to specify the current status of the specified blood product as indicated by the filler or placer.  For example, the first status change of a product that may trigger a Blood Product Dispense Status Message occurs when it first becomes linked to a patient and is ready to dispense. The placer system may use the Blood Product Dispense Status Message to request the transfusion service to dispense the product.  When the blood product is delivered or issued to a patient, the status of the blood product would be changed to indicate that it has now been \"dispensed\".  Used in the Blood Product Dispense Status (BPX) segment in HL7 Version 2.x messaging.",
