  "description": "Code system of concepts that identify the significance or priority of the diagnosis code.  Note that the codes are numeric, and the number of the code represents the ordinal priority of the associated diagnosis.  Used in the DG1 segment in HL7 Version 2.x messaging. The predefined codes are the most common, and just a starter set, as the codes are an unbounded list; additional ranked procedures may be signified by incrementing the code value as needed.",
